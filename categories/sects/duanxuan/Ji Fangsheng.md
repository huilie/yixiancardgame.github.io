## Recommended Build: Self Debuff + Physique

Survive until reaching Immortality (purple) Phase with a physique build, keeping (but not yet using) cards that remove/prevent debuffs and building physique.\
Then choose the Immortal Fate: "Meditation of Xuan".

After this, you can begin to adjust your build by pairing "Meditation of Xuan", with a few anti-debuffing cards to remove some  internal injury while keeping regeneration.

Keep building physique, and then select the Immortal Fate "Wan Xuan Demon Breaking Palm" after reaching Incarnation Phase. 

Afterwards, spam "Wan Xuan Demon Breaking Palm" as much as you can with agility cards as it not only removes debuffs (most notably internal injury from Meditation of Xuan), but also gives attack up. This allows you to scale both in terms of regeneration stacks and attack up stacks.

Strong Against: Chip / Other Scaling Decks\
Weak Against: Damage Bursts (e.g. Dharma Spirit Sword)
