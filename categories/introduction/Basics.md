**ATK**\
ATK deals damage to opponents. If it says 3 ATK, then it will deal 3 damage. If it says 1~5 ATK, then it deals a random amount of damage between 1~5. 

{: .warning}
**DEF**\
DEF ignores your opponent's attack. If you gain 5 DEF, you will be able to ignore 5 ATK from your opponent. DEF decreases every turn.

**Qi**\
Qi is often the 'energy' required to play the card. On the top left corner of the card, if it says a number on a blue flower-looking shape, that's the 'Qi required to play'. If it says 2 on the top left corner, you need at least 2 Qi in order to play the card. Qi can be obtained through other cards. In the card description, it will say something like "+2 Qi".

Chase is a special action in the game where you skip your opponents turn, letting you act twice in a single turn. You cannot Chase a Chase card.
