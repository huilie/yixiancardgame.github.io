DEF DEF ignores your opponent’s attack. If you gain 5 DEF, you will be able to ignore 5 ATK from your opponent. DEF decreases every turn. Qi Qi is often the ‘energy’ required to play the card. On the top left corner of the card, if it says a number on a blue flower-looking shape, that’s the ‘Qi required to play’. If it says 2 on the top left corner, you need at least 2 Qi in order to play the card. Qi can be obtained through other cards. In the card description, it will say something like “+2 Qi”. Chase Chase is a special action in the game where you skip your opponents turn, letting you act twice in a single turn. You cannot Chase a Chase card. Continuous ‘Continuous’ is a special condition given to a card. In the description, it should say ‘Continuous’ in pink. This means that the card’s effect will be triggered every turn. “Continuous X times”, means that the card’s effect will only be triggered for X times per battle. Consumption ‘Consumption’ is also a special condition given to a card. Same with ‘Continuous’, it will be in pink. This means that you can only play this card once per battle. NOTE: These are the basic terms that you should know (in general) before playing the game. These terms apply to every sect. There are other basic terms that is useful to know when playing different sects. Descriptions of sect-limited terms are in the sect’s page in this Wiki. ",
